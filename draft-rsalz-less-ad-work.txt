                  Making Less work for Area Directors
                    draft-rsalz-less-ad-work-latest

Abstract

   This draft proposes a number of ways that the Area Director workload
   can be reduced.  It will be up to the IETF consensus process to set
   the final list.

   A major goal of this effort is to make it feasible for a wider
   diversity of people to volunteer as a candidate for AD.  Anecdotally,
   every IESG complains about the AD workload, and says that it takes
   the first full term to understand the job.

1.  Introduction

   Repeat the abstract.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  History of IESG Job Descriptions

   It might be useful to look at the job descriptions that the IESG
   provided to NomCom over the years.

   In 2016, the description said

      The basic IESG activities can consume between 15-40 hours a week.

   In 2017, this changed to

      The ability to contribute more time is useful, but if the NomCom
      should pick a few ADs who can only do 15 hrs/week on a routine
      basis, the IESG can cope with that.

   Starting with the 2018 NomCom, this changed to the following

      Many ADs allocate 15 hours or more per week...

   This boilerplate has been unchanged in the five years since then.

      *TODO:* Would be interesting to find out why this changed.

   Interestingly, the number of pages has also not changed "read on the
   order of 500 pages of internet-drafts every two weeks."

      *TODO:* Get pagecounts for the past several years; maybe from the
      sodastream folks?

4.  Rationale

   We need to make the AD job (except for the IETF Chair), less time-
   consuming.  The current requirement is not sustainable, and will lead
   to centralization of technical leadership in only the largest
   companies.  Of the 14 current Area Directors, eight (more than half)
   work for the one of the 2,000 largest global companies [FORBES] or a
   subsidiary.

      *TODO:* Look at previous IESG membership

5.  Recommendations/Suggestions

5.1.  Only one AD to approve

   An Internet-Draft ballot should allow only one AD in each area to
   vote.  The other director(s) can either vote "no objection" or the
   ballot tracking can be modified to handle this more directly.
   Coordination between area ADs is left to them to handle; this
   document suggests that the _non-responsible_ AD be the one to vote.
   During discussion, all ADs should participate.

   For any area with a directorate, the default ballot position should
   be to accept that review, if one is given.

5.2.  No "revisit" documents open across change-over

   An incoming AD should not pick up the documents left by the
   predecessor.  A new AD should not add be able to add work on authors,
   or for them.

   If the IESG believes that a previous AD did a poor job, it should
   vote on that and announce it to the IETF community.

5.3.  Documents, not scheduling

   What is the rationale for the IESG setting meeting logistics?  How
   much time is consumed with scheduling?

   We have professional staff, with Board oversight, and consultations.
   The meeting venue requirements are being discussed as an update to
   [RFC8718] and any policy changes will be acted on.

5.4.  Content not language

   It is not an effective use of technical experts to review and correct
   for things like typo's, etc.  We recognize that many ADs will be
   "unable to help themselves" as the personality trait of nit-picking
   is endemic to our profession.  ADs can point out things that are not
   clear, and if there are many of them, feel free to send the document
   back to the WG.  This will be hard, particularly for contributors
   where English is not their native language.  Perhaps the IETF can
   offer resources to help with this before a document gets to the RFC
   Production Center (which is more focused on copyediting, anyway).

6.  Increasing the candidate pool

   This document offers a number of suggestions to reduce the workload
   of an IETF Area Director.  Previous NomCom's have repeatedly heard
   that the effort is involved is a full-time job.  Few companies other
   than large IT or Internet firms, can afford this.  This document
   offers some suggestions, in addition to reducing the workload, that
   might help increase the diversity of candidates.

6.1.  Reimburse travel

   Might help get more volunteers from other (less-wealthy? smaller
   companies?) parts of the world.  We have learned to accomodate more
   remote meetings, perhaps that is enough.

6.2.  Pre-AD training

   "So you want to be an AD" could be worthwhile training to offer.  Of
   course the IESG and the way the work vary, and it would have to be
   done in consultation with them.

7.  Security Considerations

   This changes the IESG review process.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
